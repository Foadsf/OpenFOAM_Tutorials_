in order to solve the FOAM FATAL ERROR: Unknown TurbulenceModel type RASModel issue as described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48421407/openfoam-foam-fatal-error-unknown-turbulencemodel-type-rasmodel/48428177#48428177

DESCRIPTION:
Here we will do a simple 2D axisymmetric simulation of a donut shape in freestream. The 'wedge' boundary condition will be introduced and details on setting up an axisymmetric case will be shown.

OUTLINE:
-Use rotational extrude in Gmsh to create a wedge shape.
-Convert the mesh and change the boundary file.
-Change the write format in system/controlDict to 'binary' to prevent errors.
-Run the simulation and view post-processed results.

COMMANDS:
- gmsh mesh/main.geo -3 -o test.msh
- gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
- Modify case/constant/polyMesh/boundary your edited file should look like this: https://github.com/Foadsf/OpenFOAM_Tutorials_/blob/master/Axisymmetric2D/case/constant/boundary.back
- Modify Axisymmetric2D/case/constant/RASProperties as this: https://github.com/Foadsf/OpenFOAM_Tutorials_/blob/master/Axisymmetric2D/case/constant/RASProperties.bak
- edit case/constant/turbulenceProperties like this: https://github.com/Foadsf/OpenFOAM_Tutorials_/blob/master/Axisymmetric2D/case/constant/turbulenceProperties.back
- in case/system/fvSchemes change the line div((nuEff*dev(T(grad(U))))) Gauss linear; to div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))) Gauss linear;
- run pimpleFoam in the case folder
